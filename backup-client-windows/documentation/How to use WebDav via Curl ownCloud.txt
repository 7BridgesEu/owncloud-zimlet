How to use WebDav via Curl

I recently had to assist in automating a few interactions with an Owncloud deployment. Here are the command used to interact with WebDav via Curl

Download file


curl -u user:'pass' https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/fileName --output fileName
1
curl -u user:'pass' https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/fileName --output fileName
List Directory


curl -u user:'pass' -X PROPFIND https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/
1
curl -u user:'pass' -X PROPFIND https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/
Create Directory


curl -u user:'pass' -X MKCOL https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/directoryName
1
curl -u user:'pass' -X MKCOL https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/directoryName
Delete


curl -u user:'pass' -X DELETE https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/directoryOrFileName
1
curl -u user:'pass' -X DELETE https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/directoryOrFileName
Upload


curl -u user:'pass' -T fileToUpload https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/directory/
1
curl -u user:'pass' -T fileToUpload https://owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav/directory/



Working example:
curl -u barry:AhHuhah8 -T "/home/bar/test.txt" https://ams01.ownCloud/remote.php/webdav/Documenti/
